# TextToSpeach
VOICES ARE ALL HARD CODED IN THE COMBO BOX (Because i only needed the Portuguese voices) easy to change tho , might switch up later to show all available voices 

2 small windows forms projects to test Text To Speach api from Azure and IBM , set your own api keys on the config files :)

Project can open files from a txt instead of typing , files are encrypted after converted , you can select from all voice available (PT), made this progam in 2 hours not a lot of control it was ment just to test the different voices :)
