# TextToSpeach


2 small windows forms projects to test Text To Speach api from Azure and IBM , set your own api keys on the config files might need to change other conifg depending on your zone :)


Project can open files from a txt instead of typing , files are encrypted after converted , you can select from all voice available (Azure only(PT) see 1. ), made this progam in 2 hours not a lot of control it was ment just to test the different voices :)

---THING THAT I MIGHT CHANGE LATER---


1.VOICES ARE ALL HARD CODED IN THE COMBO BOX IN THE AZURE PROJECT (Because i only needed the Portuguese voices) easy to change tho , might switch up later to show all available voices already did that for the IBM Project tho)


2.Save Location is the default resources folder in the debug folder , might add a config to change that


3.Overall ui and ad things to methods instead of leaving it all on the code main file xD
